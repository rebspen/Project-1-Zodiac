This is my Ironhack Game - Zodiac

Created on the third week of the course (3rd-8th November).

It is a relaxing medatative game. make sure you keep the sound on!

You put in your date of birth and then the game take syou on a personalised galatic adventure. You have to collect your zodiac's element and lucky gem stone to get points, but avoid asteroids.

At the end of the game you get a horoscope personalised to your star sign (only if you get a score bigger than 0!).

Enjoy!!
